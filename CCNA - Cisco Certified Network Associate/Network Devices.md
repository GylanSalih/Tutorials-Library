# Network Devices

**A Computer Network** - a digital telecommunication network which allows nodes to share resources.

**Examples of Network Devices:**

- Router
- Switch
- Firewall (Software and Hardware)
- Server
- Client

**A Client** - a device that accesses a service made by a server.

**A Server** - a device that provides function or services for clients.

The same device can e a client in some situations, and a server in other situations.

**Switches**

Switches are used to forward traffic within a LAN (Local Area Network). E.g., The Catalyst 9200 and Catalyst 3650.

**Characteristics of Switches:**

- They have many different network interfaces / ports for end hosts to connect to (usually 24+).
- They provide connectivity for hosts within the same LAN (Local Area Network).
- Switches do not provide connectivity between LANs / over the internet.

**Routers**

Routers are used to connect different LANs. E.g., The ISR 1000, ISR 900 and ISR 4000.

**Characteristics of Routers:**

- Routers have fewer network interfaces than switches.
- They are used to provide connectivity between LANs.
- They are used to send data over the internet.

**Firewalls**

Firewalls are networking devices which are used to monitor a network’s traffic. E.g., The ASA5500-X and Firepower 2100.

Characteristics of Firewalls:

- Firewalls monitor and control network traffic based on configured rules.
- They can be placed inside or outside of a network. This means that they can filter traffic either before or after it has reached the router.
- Firewalls are known as “Next Generation” firewalls when the include more modern and advanced filtering capabilities.

**Network Firewalls** - These are hardware devices that filter traffic between networks.

**Host-Based Firewalls** - These are software applications that filter traffic entering and exiting a host machine, like a PC.
