## What are Network Diagnostic Tools? 🛠️  

Network diagnostic tools are used to **test, monitor, and troubleshoot network connectivity and performance**. They help identify:  
✅ **Connectivity issues** (e.g., unreachable hosts, packet loss)  
✅ **Routing problems** (e.g., network congestion, misconfigurations)  
✅ **Security threats** (e.g., suspicious traffic, network attacks)  

The three most common tools are:  
- **Ping** – Tests connectivity and measures packet loss & latency.  
- **Traceroute** – Maps the path data takes through the network.  
- **Wireshark** – Captures and analyzes network traffic at the packet level.

## Ping 📡  

### 🔹 How Ping Works  
**Ping (Packet Internet Groper)** is a command-line tool that checks if a device is reachable on a network. It sends **ICMP Echo Request** packets to a destination and waits for an **ICMP Echo Reply**.  

If the reply is received, the device is online; otherwise, it might be down or unreachable.  

### 🔹 Ping Syntax and Options  
#### Basic Ping Command:  
```bash
ping google.com
```
#### Common Ping Options:  
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-c <count>` | Sends a specific number of ping requests. |
| `-i <interval>` | Sets the interval between pings. |
| `-t` (Windows) | Sends pings indefinitely. |
| `-w <timeout>` | Sets a timeout for the ping process. |
| `-s <size>` | Specifies the packet size. |

#### Example:  
Ping **8.8.8.8** with 5 packets and a 1-second interval:  
```bash
ping -c 5 -i 1 8.8.8.8
```

#### Ping Output Breakdown:  
```
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=118 time=12.3 ms
```
- `64 bytes` – Packet size  
- `icmp_seq=1` – Sequence number  
- `ttl=118` – Time to live (number of hops before the packet is discarded)  
- `time=12.3 ms` – Round-trip time  

📌 **Use Case:** Ping helps diagnose **network latency, packet loss, and connection failures**.

## Traceroute 🛤️  

### 🔹 How Traceroute Works  
Traceroute maps the **route packets take** to reach a destination. It sends **ICMP Time Exceeded messages** to track each hop.  

If a router doesn’t respond, `* * *` appears in the output, indicating a possible firewall or timeout issue.  

### 🔹 Traceroute Syntax and Options  
#### Basic Traceroute Command (Linux/macOS):  
```bash
traceroute google.com
```
#### Basic Traceroute Command (Windows):  
```bash
tracert google.com
```

#### Common Traceroute Options:  
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-m <hops>` | Sets the max number of hops (default is 30). |
| `-q <probes>` | Number of packets per hop. |
| `-w <timeout>` | Timeout for each response. |

#### Example:  
Traceroute with a max of 10 hops and a 1-second timeout:  
```bash
traceroute -m 10 -w 1 google.com
```

#### Sample Traceroute Output:  
```
1  192.168.1.1   1.5 ms  
2  203.0.113.5   12.6 ms  
3  93.184.216.34 22.4 ms  
```
📌 **Use Case:** Traceroute helps detect **network congestion, routing loops, and misconfigured routers**.

## Wireshark 🦈  

### 🔹 What is Wireshark?  
Wireshark is a **packet analyzer** that captures and inspects network traffic in real-time. It helps network admins **troubleshoot issues and analyze security threats**.  

🖥️ **Download Wireshark:** [https://www.wireshark.org/download.html](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)  

### 🔹 How to Capture Packets with Wireshark  
1. Open Wireshark and select a **network interface** (e.g., Wi-Fi, Ethernet).  
2. Click **"Start Capture"** to begin recording traffic.  
3. Stop the capture after gathering sufficient data.  

🔍 **Filters for Focused Analysis:**  
| Filter | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ip.addr == 8.8.8.8` | Show traffic to/from a specific IP. |
| `tcp.port == 80` | Show HTTP traffic. |
| `http` | Show only HTTP requests/responses. |
| `icmp` | Show only ping requests. |

### 🔹 Analyzing Packets in Wireshark  
Each packet contains:  
- **Source & Destination IP** – Who sent/received the data.  
- **Protocol** – Type of communication (HTTP, DNS, TCP, etc.).  
- **Packet Size** – Data volume transferred.  

#### Example: Detecting Slow Network Issues  
1. **Check Ping Requests**: High `time=` values indicate delay.  
2. **Analyze TCP Packets**: Look for retransmissions or slow handshake.  
3. **Identify Dropped Packets**: Check for `ICMP Destination Unreachable` errors.  

📌 **Use Case:** Wireshark is used for **network troubleshooting, security analysis, and packet inspection**.

## Conclusion ✅  

These three tools are **essential for network troubleshooting and security analysis**:  
- **Ping** checks connectivity and measures latency.  
- **Traceroute** maps network paths and identifies slow routers.  
- **Wireshark** captures and analyzes network traffic at a deep level.  

By mastering these tools, you can quickly diagnose **network failures, latency issues, and security threats**. 🚀
